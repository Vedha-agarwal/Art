    <p>I like art beacuse Art, in any form, can give people emotions that can lift up their spirit and make them more driven than ever.Art is important because creativity is the foundation of a child's education. It helps to develop motor skills, eye-hand coordination and has a large impact on their social and emotional growth. Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. It produces a product, an object.Art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, and skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. .Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing the author's imaginative mind. The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience.
